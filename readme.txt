TKServer's GOLF SCORES for Wordpress is a Wordpress plugin/widget which tracks a single WP member's golf scores.  The application is great for tracking 9 or 18 hole golf rounds or frisbee golf rounds.  Golf Scores automatically calculates net scores, shows scoring history, and has a comment area for each round's commentary.  The plugin includes full administrative back end featuring score entry, score editing and/or moderation.
